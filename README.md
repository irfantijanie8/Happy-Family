## The Rules of The Game
1) Every player will be assigned 8 cards each at the start of the game
2) If a player have cards with the same family name in a complete set of four, the cards will be removed from his deck.
3) A player can get a new card by pulling it from the card's stack.
4) A player can also get new card by guessing the card that an opponent have. If the player guess right,
the opponent must give the player the guess card. If the player is wrong, the player must pull one card from
the stack
5) The players can give their card to their group members.
6) The first group that don't have any card in their decks will be the winner
